ðŸ§  Challenges & Solutions
Challenge: Figuring out how to check file size and modification time.
Solution: Used os.path.getsize() and os.path.getmtime() with time.time() to compare.

âœ… Conclusion
This project helped me understand how file systems can be explored programmatically and gave me hands-on experience with Pythonâ€™s os, argparse, and time libraries. The tool works well for lightweight search tasks and could be extended with features like deleting/moving files or exporting to CSV.
